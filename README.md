<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wanted to create a simple tool that would make reading code more accessible and organized. This is how this AI code comment generator came to life. This AI code comment generator was created to make reading and understanding code easier. I wanted a tool that could automatically generate meaningful comments to explain code, helping developers quickly grasp the purpose and functionality of various sections. The goal of this project was to save time and improve coding practices by simplifying the documentation process.
